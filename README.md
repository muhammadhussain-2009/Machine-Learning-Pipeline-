## Overview

The **Machine Learning Pipeline** is an all-in-one Jupyter Notebook designed to simplify the complexities of developing, training, and deploying machine learning models. We‚Äôll explore how to create efficient pipelines using Scikit-Learn to streamline your ML models. 

Discover the essential techniques for data encoding, preprocessing, and automating workflows to handle complex datasets like a pro. 

Our Task is to Predict how much CO‚ÇÇ a vehicle will emit based on its characteristics.

**Why Machine Learning Pipeline?**

This project empowers developers to efficiently manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning projects. The core features include:

- üé® **Data Preparation:** Streamlines the cleaning and transformation of raw data for accurate model predictions.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Model Training:** Offers a structured approach to experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameters.
- üìä **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides methods to assess model performance, enabling informed decision-making.
- üåü **Visualization:** Enhances interpretability of data distributions and model performance through insightful visual aids.
